# pands-weekly-tasks

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my progress and skills in programming and scripting by writing simple programs using Python.

## Description

In this repository, you will find scripts that demonstrate my abilities in Python programming. Each program is designed to highlight different aspects of programming and scripting, covering a wide range of topics and techniques. 

## Contents

The repository includes weekly task programs:

- `week1`: Write program [helloworld.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/helloworld.py) that displays Hello World! when it is run.
- `week2`: Write a program called [bank.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/bank.py) 
The program should:
    *  Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
    *  Add the two amounts
    *  Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount. 
- `week3`: Write a python program called [accounts.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/accounts.py) that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
- `week4`: Write a program, called collatz.py[collatz.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/collatz.py), that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Have the program end if the current value is one.
- `week5`: Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. The program is called [weekday.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/weekday.py)
You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is.
- `week6`: Write a program called [squareroot.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/squareroot.py) that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. You should create a function called sqrt that does this.
- `week7`: Write a program [es.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/es.py) that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. The program takes the filename from an argument on the command line.
- `week8`: Write a program called [plottask.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/plottask.py) that displays:
   * a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
   * a plot of the function  $h(x) = x^3$ in the range 0 to 10,

   on the one set of axes.



Feel free to explore each program to learn more about the programs and scripts I have worked on. I tried to make code easier to understand by making a lot of comments. Each program includes referal links to webpages which help to understand the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks.git`
2. Navigate to directories: `cd pands-weekly-tasks`
3. To make easier analize and run code I recommend to use VS Code.
4. To avoid errors, make sure that you use the proper path to files which you are trying to run.
