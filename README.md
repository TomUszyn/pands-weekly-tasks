# pands-weekly-tasks

This repository is dedicated to showcasing my progress and skills in programming and scripting by writing simple programs using Python.

## Description

In this repository, you will find scripts that demonstrate my abilities in Python programming. Each program is designed to highlight different aspects of programming and scripting, covering a wide range of topics and techniques. 

## Contents

The repository includes weekly task programs:

- `week1`: Write program [helloworld.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/helloworld.py), that displays Hello World! when it is run.
- `week2`: Write a program called [bank.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/bank.py). 
The program should:
    *  Prompt the user and read in two money amounts (in cent)
    *  Add the two amounts
    *  Print out the answer in a human readable format with a euro sign and decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount. 
- `week3`: Write a python program called [accounts.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/accounts.py), that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).
- `week4`: Write a program, called [collatz.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/collatz.py), that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
Have the program end if the current value is one.
- `week5`: Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday. The program is called [weekday.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/weekday.py).
You will need to search the web to find how you work out what day it is.
- `week6`: Write a program called [squareroot.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/squareroot.py) that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. You should create a function called sqrt that does this.
- `week7`: Write a program [es.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/es.py) that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's it contains. The program takes the filename from an argument on the command line.
- `week8`: Write a program called [plottask.py](https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks/blob/main/plottask.py) that displays:
   * a histogram of a normal distribution of a 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2, 
   * a plot of the function  $h(x) = x^3$ in the range 0 to 10,

     on the one set of axes.

To read more about each file go to the [Documentation Jupyter Notebook](Documentation.ipynb).

Feel free to explore each program to learn more about the programs and scripts I have worked on. I tried to make code easier to understand by making a lot of comments. Each program includes referal links to webpages which help to understand the code.

## Getting Started

If you want to be sure that you have the right programming environment for this repository, you should follow these extra 
steps:

1. Install Anaconda: 
    - Download the Anaconda distribution for your operating system from the official Anaconda website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

2. Install Git:
    - Download Git for your operating system from the official Git website: https://git-scm.com/downloads
    - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

3. Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code):
    - Download Visual Studio Code for your operating system from the official VS Code website: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    - Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

4. Configure Git:
    - Open a terminal or Git Bash.
    - Set your name and email address using the following commands:
      ```
      git config --global user.name "Your Name"
      git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
      ```

5. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/TomUszyn/pands-weekly-tasks.git
    ```

6. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    ```
    cd pands-weekly-tasks

7. In VS Code, pick one of the available programs with extension .py from the pands-weekly-tasks folder, run the program
by typing the file name, and press enter to execute it. There is only one exception in the case of the es.py file, where the user must input the name of the .txt file as an argument.

Notice: Make sure you are in the correct patch for the file you are trying to execute. Otherwise, you may encounter an error.
