    "    To write this program, are needed research to understand variables, data types and basic operators. Our task involves manipulating  strings, which requires string slicing and concatenation knowledge. String slicing is used to extract the portion of the string (in  this case, the last four digits), and concatenation is used to combine strings (in this case, 'X’s and the last four digits). The length of a String (len() function) in Python is used to get the number of characters in a string. it will be used to calculate the number of 'X’s needed. To find out the last four digits, negative indexing is used. \n",

    "    To write a program that outputs whether or not today is a weekday is needed to use the Python datetime module, which provides various functions to work with dates and times. One of the helpful functions in this case is weekday(). The function returns an integer related to the day of the week (in this case, Monday is 0, and Sunday is 6). This function checks whether the current date is a weekday or a weekend and prints a message accordingly. The addition operator (+) adds one to the current value.

    "    Newton's method is a popular and effective numerical technique for finding the roots of a given function, including square roots. If someone needs to find the square root of a positive number (n), using Newton's method can be a good option. The method involves iteratively improving the initial guess until it converges to an accurate value. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To use Newton's method for square root approximation, one needs to follow a few steps.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    First, an initial guess (x) needs to be made, which can be any positive value, but it's often set to 1 or n. \n",
    "    Then, an iterative update formula is used to update the guess, which is given by: \n",
    "    <br>$nextGuess = 0.5*(x + n/x)$ \n",
    "    <br>After each update, the difference between the current guess and the next guess is calculated. If the difference is within a specified tolerance level, the iteration stops. Otherwise, the process is repeated with the new guess until the tolerance level is met. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To implement the algorithm, one needs to follow a few research and implementation steps. First, it's crucial to understand the mathematical basis of Newton's method for square root approximation and how the iterative process converges to the actual square root. Once this is done, a function can be written that takes the input number (n) and a tolerance level as arguments. The initial guess is set to 1, and a loop is used to iteratively update the guess until the difference between consecutive guesses is less than the tolerance. Finally, the function returns the final guess as the square root of (n).\n",
