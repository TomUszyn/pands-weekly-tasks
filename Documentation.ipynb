It is necessary to  understand how to perform basic arithmetic operations, adding two accounts and converting cents to euros. It is important to know how to correctly format the output to display the total in euros. This can be done using Python’s built-in format function or f-strings.\n",

    "    To write this program, are needed research to understand variables, data types and basic operators. Our task involves manipulating  strings, which requires string slicing and concatenation knowledge. String slicing is used to extract the portion of the string (in  this case, the last four digits), and concatenation is used to combine strings (in this case, 'X’s and the last four digits). The length of a String (len() function) in Python is used to get the number of characters in a string. it will be used to calculate the number of 'X’s needed. To find out the last four digits, negative indexing is used. \n",

    "    To write this program understanding of Collatz conjecture is needed. Understanding the concept of loops and conditional statements is necessary. While the loop is executed until the     current value is one. If the statement is used to check if the current value is even or odd. The modulo operator (%) is used to check   if the current value is even or odd. The floor division operator (//) divides the current value by two. The multiplication operator   (*) is used to multiply the current value by three. The addition operator (+) adds one to the current value. The end parameter of the     print() function is used to print the values in the same line.\n",
