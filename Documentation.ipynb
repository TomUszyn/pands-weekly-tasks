    "    Newton's method is a popular and effective numerical technique for finding the roots of a given function, including square roots. If someone needs to find the square root of a positive number (n), using Newton's method can be a good option. The method involves iteratively improving the initial guess until it converges to an accurate value. \n",

    "    To implement the algorithm, one needs to follow a few research and implementation steps. First, it's crucial to understand the mathematical basis of Newton's method for square root approximation and how the iterative process converges to the actual square root. Once this is done, a function can be written that takes the input number (n) and a tolerance level as arguments. The initial guess is set to 1, and a loop is used to iteratively update the guess until the difference between consecutive guesses is less than the tolerance. Finally, the function returns the final guess as the square root of (n).\n",

    "    To understand how to write this program, a basic    understanding of Python programming language is necessary, including importing libraries, generating random data, and plotting using matplotlib.pyplot. The code simulates an experiment with 1000 values with a mean of 5 and standard deviation of 2 and then plotted as a histogram with a normal distribution. The program then plots a mathematical function $h(x) = x^3$ alongside the histogram using a second y-axis and x-axis. It is necessary to have a basic understanding of histograms, bins, and normal distributions. \n",

    "    The task requires displaying the histogram and plotting the function $h(x)=x^3$ on the one set of axes. The twinx() function is used to create a second y-axis. This function allows the creation of a second y-axis that shares the same x-axis. Using the twinx() makes the plot easier to read and understand. \n",
    "    The matplotlib library displays the histogram and the   function plot $h(x)=x^3$. The textwrap library wraps the  plot's title to fit within the plot. Edgecolor helps to distinguish the  bins in the histogram. The square root rule says that the number of bins which is calculated as the square root of the number of data points. Based on this rule, it's easy to find the best number of bins. Bins number is set to 30. Adding a grid to the plot makes it easier to read.\n",
